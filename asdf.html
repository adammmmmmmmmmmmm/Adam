	<p>The snow glows white on the mountain tonight<br />
	Not a footprint to be seen<br />
	A kingdom of isolation,<br />
	And it looks like I'm the queen.<br />
	<br />
	The wind is howling like this swirling storm inside<br />
	Couldn't keep it in, heaven knows I tried!<br />
	<br />
	Don't let them in, don't let them see<br />
	Be the good girl you always have to be<br />
	Conceal, don't feel, don't let them know<br />
	Well, now they know!<br />
	<br />
	Let it go, let it go<br />
	Can't hold it back anymore<br />
	Let it go, let it go<br />
	Turn away and slam the door!<br />
	<br />
	I don't care<br />
	What they're going to say<br />
	Let the storm rage on,<br />
	The cold never bothered me anyway!<br />
	<br />
	It's funny how some distance<br />
	Makes everything seem small<br />
	And the fears that once controlled me<br />
	Can't get to me at all!<br />
	<br />
	It's time to see what I can do<br />
	To test the limits and break through<br />
	No right, no wrong, no rules for me I'm free!<br />
	<br />
	Let it go, let it go<br />
	I am one with the wind and sky<br />
	Let it go, let it go<br />
	You'll never see me cry!<br />
	<br />
	Here I stand<br />
	And here I'll stay<br />
	Let the storm rage on!<br />
	<br />
	My power flurries through the air into the ground<br />
	My soul is spiraling in frozen fractals all around<br />
	And one thought crystallizes like an icy blast<br />
	I'm never going back,<br />
	The past is in the past!<br />
	<br />
	Let it go, let it go<br />
	And I'll rise like the break of dawn<br />
	Let it go, let it go<br />
	That perfect girl is gone!<br />
	<br />
	Here I stand<br />
	In the light of day<br />
	Let the storm rage on,<br />
	The cold never bothered me anyway!
